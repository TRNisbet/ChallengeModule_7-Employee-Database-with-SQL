## Module 7 Challenge

### Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to a) determine the number
of retiring employees by title and b) determine the number of employees eligible
for the Mentorship Program.

### Results

The company will see the following number of retirements in
the internally coined "Silver Tsunami":

• Senior Engineer: 25916

 • Senior Staff:  24926

• Engineer: 9285

• Staff: 7636

• Technique Leader: 3603

• Assistant Engineer: 1090

• Manager: 2

• Total Employees in the Silver Tsunami: 72458

The company has 1549 Employees available for the mentorship
program.  If the company replaces all the retirement positions with a new employee and wishes for each employee to have a mentor then each mentor would have 46.777 apprentices.

### Summary

The company will face a large amount of retirement in the
"Silver Tsunami", which will equate to 24.15% of its total employees.  While it is possible that all of these employees will not retire in the short-term future, the potential impact could be devastating to the company if the company does plan for the possibility.  It is recommended that the company look into expanding the mentorship program by evaluating potential mentors based on time with the company instead of age.  Using only the employee's age could lead to older new hires being eligible for mentorships, while excluding younger employees enough internal experience to be considered a good candidate.  Additionally, it is recommended the company examine the number of employees in a department compared to those which could be in the Silver Tsunami.  The percentage
of people retiring from a department would be a better indication of how much
impact the Silver Tsunami will affect the department than a strict number count. The company will need to look at ways to reorganize business functions, workflow, or otherwise increase efficiencies to see if a one to one ratio of retiring employee to new hire is needed.  In places where changes in the business cannot overcome the drastic reduction in force then the company will need to take steps to quickly address the potential labor shortage.
